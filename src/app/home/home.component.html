        <p><span class="underline">First Rule of SH:</span> You don't talk about SH.</p>
        <p><span class="underline">Second Rule of SH:</span> You don't talk about SH.</p>
        <p><span class="underline">Third Rule of SH:</span> Once you receive a card, you will judge how BAD is that situation, sequencing that in your card deck. If you misjudge, well tough luck.</p>
        <p><span class="underline">Fourth Rule of SH:</span> You can check the numbers in the left to help you identify where you should fit your card. The higher the number, the worst is the situation.</p>
        <p><span class="underline">Fifth Rule of SH:</span> Every team starts with 3 cards.</p>
        <p><span class="underline">Sixth Rule of SH:</span> The maximum number of cards per team is 7</p>
        <p><span class="underline">Seventh Rule of SH:</span> If the game runs out of cards, the number of cards of each team will be counted, and the winner will be the one (or ones) with more care cards in their possession.</p>
        <p><span class="underline">Ninth and Final Rule of SH:</span> You already plays it in your daily life, and now you have to play it here. Life is tough: get over it.</p>
